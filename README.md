## Abstract
The unique morphology of grass stomata enables rapid responses to environmental changes. Deciphering the basis for these responses is critical for improving food security. We have developed a planta platform of single nucleus RNA-sequencing by combined fluorescence-activated nuclei flow sorting and identified cell types in mature and developing stomata from 33,098 nuclei in maize (Zea mays) epidermis. Guard and subsidiary cells displayed differential expression for genes involved in the abscisic acid, CO<sub>2</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, starch metabolism, and blue light signaling pathways besides transporters, implicating coordinated signal integration in speedy stomatal responses, and for genes affecting cell wall plasticity, implying a more sophisticated relationship between guard and subsidiary cells in stomatal development and dumbbell-shaped guard cell formation. The trajectory identified in young tissues, and by comparison to the *MUTE* defective mutant in stomatal development, confirmed known features and uncovered key participants . Our study provides a valuable, comprehensive, and fundamental foundation for further insights into grass stomatal function.
